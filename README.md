This is a simple wrap of some of the libSBML functionality, mainly the model loading for purposes of COBRA analysis methods.

Other functionality will be added as needed. Feel free to submit a PR that increases the loading "coverage".

## Installation

```julia
]add SBML # or
using Pkg; Pkg.add("SBML")
```

## Usage

```julia
using SBML
m = readSBML("myModel.xml")

# m is now a Model structure with:
m.reactions
m.species
m.compartments
...
```

There are several helper functions, for example you can get a nice list of reactions, metabolites and the stoichiometric matrix as follows:

```julia
mets, rxns, S = getS(m)
```

If you are looking to use dynamic SBML models with the Julia DifferentialEquations ecosystem, please refer to [SBMLToolkit.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SBMLToolkit.jl).
